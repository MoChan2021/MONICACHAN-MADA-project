  abstract = "Efficient microbial sampling from surfaces for subsequent
              detection and quantification is crucial in fields such as food
              safety and hygiene monitoring. Cotton swabs are traditionally
              used for sample collection, but today there are numerous swabs of
              alternative material and different sizes available. Recovery
              efficiencies of swabs for different applications have been
              compared in several studies. However, the results are often
              contradictory. We have compared 15 different swabs made of cotton
              (n = 5), flocked nylon (n = 3) and foam (n = 7), for sampling of
              Listeria monocytogenes and mengovirus on small (4 cm2) and large
              (100 cm2) areas of window glass, ridged plastic and absorbing
              wood. Molecular quantification methods (qPCR and RT-qPCR) were
              applied, and all sampling and sample processing were
              standardized. Specific swabs gave higher DNA/RNA yields than
              others, depending on both the surface characteristics and the
              collected target. The highest DNA yields were achieved by
              applying Selefa or Puritan cotton swabs for Listeria sampling on
              4 cm2 areas of window glass and ridged plastic. Certain foam
              swabs (Critical swab with medium head and Macrofoam) gave the
              highest yields when sampling Listeria on 4 cm2 areas of wood and
              on 100 cm2 areas of ridged plastic and wood. Most foam swabs, and
              especially Sigma Virocult, were advantageous for virus sampling,
              regardless of surface. Nylon-flocked swabs showed poor recovery
              regardless of surface characteristics. The recovery varied
              substantially between swabs made of the same material, suggesting
              that a single swab may not be representative for a certain swab
              material.",

              causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
              pandemic. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain
              reaction (qRT-PCR) represents the gold standard for diagnostic
              assays even if it cannot precisely quantify viral RNA copies.
              Thus, we decided to compare qRT-PCR with digital polymerase chain
              reaction (dPCR), which is able to give an accurate number of RNA
              copies that can be found in a specimen. However, the
              aforementioned methods are not capable to discriminate if the
              detected RNA is infectious or not. For this purpose, it is
              necessary to perform an endpoint titration on cell cultures,
              which is largely used in the research field and provides a tissue
              culture infecting dose per mL (TCID50/mL) value. Both research

              two qRT-PCR protocols (one with preliminary RNA extraction and
              purification and an extraction-free qRT-PCR), a dPCR and a
              titration on cell cultures. The resulting correlations yield a
              faithful estimation of the total number of RNA copies and of the
              infectious viral burden from a Ct value obtained with diagnostic
              routine tests. All these estimations take into consideration

              (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread and increase the number of
              fatalities. To expedite studies on understanding potential
              surface transmission of the virus and to aid environmental
              epidemiological investigations, we developed a rapid viability
              reverse transcriptase PCR (RV-RT-PCR) method that detects viable
              (infectious) SARS-CoV-2 from swab samples in <1 day compared to
              several days required by current gold-standard cell-culture-based
              methods. The method integrates cell-culture-based viral
              enrichment in a 96-well plate format with gene-specific
              RT-PCR-based analysis before and after sample incubation to
              determine the cycle threshold (CT) difference ($\Delta$CT). An
              algorithm based on $\Delta$CT $\geq$ 6 representing âˆ¼ 2-log or
              more increase in SARS-CoV-2 RNA following enrichment determines
              the presence of infectious virus. The RV-RT-PCR method with 2-hr
              viral infection and 9-hr post-infection incubation periods
              includes ultrafiltration to concentrate virions, resulting in
              detection of <50 SARS-CoV-2 virions in swab samples in 17 h (for
              a batch of 12 swabs), compared to days typically required by the

              hospital multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) transmission.
              Factors such as patient MDRO contact precautions (CP) status,
              patient proximity to surfaces, and unit type likely influence
              MDRO contamination and bacterial bioburden levels on patient room
              surfaces. Identifying factors associated with environmental
              contamination in patient rooms and on shared unit surfaces could
              help identify important environmental MDRO transmission routes.
              METHODS: Surfaces were sampled from MDRO CP and non-CP rooms,
              nursing stations, and mobile equipment in acute care, intensive
              care, and transplant units within 6 acute care hospitals using a
              convenience sampling approach blinded to cleaning events.
              Precaution rooms had patients with clinical or surveillance tests
              positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,
              vancomycin-resistant enterococci, carbapenem-resistant
              Enterobacteriaceae or Acinetobacter within the previous 6 months,
              or Clostridioides difficile toxin within the past 30 days. Rooms
              not meeting this definition were considered non-CP rooms. Samples
              were cultured for the above MDROs and total bioburden. RESULTS:
              Overall, an estimated 13\% of rooms were contaminated with at
              least 1 MDRO. MDROs were detected more frequently in CP rooms
              (32\% of 209 room-sample events) than non-CP rooms (12\% of 234
              room-sample events). Surface bioburden did not differ
              significantly between CP and non-CP rooms or MDRO-positive and
              MDRO-negative rooms. CONCLUSIONS: CP room surfaces are
              contaminated more frequently than non-CP room surfaces; however,
              contamination of non-CP room surfaces is not uncommon and may be
              an important reservoir for ongoing MDRO transmission. MDRO
              contamination of non-CP rooms may indicate asymptomatic patient
              MDRO carriage, inadequate terminal cleaning, or
              cross-contamination of room surfaces via healthcare personnel

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Microorganisms comprise the majority of living
              organisms on our planet. For many years, exploration of the
              composition of microbial communities has been performed through
              the PCR-based study of the small subunit rRNA gene due to its
              high conservation across the domains of life. The application of
              this method has resulted in the discovery of many unexpected
              evolutionary lineages. However, amplicon sequencing is subject to
              numerous biases, with some taxa being missed, and is limited by
              the read length of second-generation sequencing platforms, which
              drastically reduces the phylogenetic resolution. RESULTS: Here,
              we describe a hybridization capture strategy that allows the
              enrichment of 16S rRNA genes from metagenomic samples and enables
              an exhaustive identification and a complete reconstruction of the
              biomarker. Applying this approach to a microbial mock community
              and a soil sample, we demonstrated that hybridization capture is
              able to reveal greater microbial diversity than 16S rDNA amplicon
              sequencing and shotgun sequencing. The reconstruction of
              full-length 16S rRNA genes facilitated the improvement of
              phylogenetic resolution and the discovery of novel prokaryotic
              taxa. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that hybridization
              capture can lead to major breakthroughs in our understanding of
              microbial diversity, overcoming the limitations of conventional
              16S rRNA gene studies. If applied to a broad range of
              environmental samples, this innovative approach could reveal the
              undescribed diversity of the still underexplored microbial
              communities and could provide a better understanding of ecosystem

              with COVID-19 to better characterize the potential risks of

              laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and with $\geq$2 members total were

  abstract = "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the
              virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019, is a respiratory
              virus primarily transmitted person to person through inhalation
              of droplets or aerosols, laden with viral particles. However, as
              recent studies have shown, virions can remain infectious for up
              to 72 h on surfaces, which can lead to transmission through
              contact. Thus, a comprehensive study was conducted to determine
              the efficiency of protocols to recover SARS-CoV-2 from surfaces
              in built environments. This end-to-end (E2E) study showed that
              the effective combination for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces
              includes using an Isohelix swab collection tool, DNA/RNA Shield
              as a preservative, an automated system for RNA extraction, and
              reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) as the detection
              assay. Using this E2E approach, this study showed that, in some
              cases, noninfectious viral fragments of SARS-CoV-2 persisted on
              surfaces for as long as 8 days even after bleach treatment.
              Additionally, debris associated with specific built environment
              surfaces appeared to inhibit and negatively impact the recovery
              of RNA; Amerstat demonstrated the highest inhibition (>90\%) when
              challenged with an inactivated viral control. Overall, it was
              determined that this E2E protocol required a minimum of 1,000
              viral particles per 25 cm2 to successfully detect virus from test
              surfaces. Despite our findings of viral fragment longevity on
              surfaces, when this method was employed to evaluate 368 samples
              collected from various built environmental surfaces, all samples
              tested negative, indicating that the surfaces were either void of
              virus or below the detection limit of the assay.IMPORTANCE The
              ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
              (SARS-CoV-2) (the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019
              [COVID-19]) pandemic has led to a global slowdown with
              far-reaching financial and social impacts. The SARS-CoV-2
              respiratory virus is primarily transmitted from person to person
              through inhalation of infected droplets or aerosols. However,
              some studies have shown that virions can remain infectious on
              surfaces for days and can lead to human infection from contact
              with infected surfaces. Thus, a comprehensive study was conducted
              to determine the efficiency of protocols to recover SARS-CoV-2
              from surfaces in built environments. This end-to-end study showed
              that the effective combination for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 on
              surfaces required a minimum of 1,000 viral particles per 25 cm2
              to successfully detect virus from surfaces. This comprehensive
              study can provide valuable information regarding surface
              monitoring of various materials as well as the capacity to retain
              viral RNA and allow for effective disinfection.",

  abstract = "The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to occur through a
              number of routes, including contact with contaminated surfaces.
              Many studies have used reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
              analysis to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces, but seldom has
              viable virus been detected. This paper investigates the viability
              over time of SARS-CoV-2 dried onto a range of materials and
              compares viability of the virus to RNA copies recovered and
              whether virus viability is concentration dependent. Viable virus
              persisted for the longest time on surgical mask material and
              stainless steel, with a 99.9\% reduction in viability by 122 and
              114 h, respectively. Viability of SARS-CoV-2 reduced the fastest
              on a polyester shirt, with a 99.9\% reduction within 2.5 h.
              Viability on the bank note was reduced second fastest, with
              99.9\% reduction in 75 h. RNA on all surfaces exhibited a 1-log
              reduction in genome copy number recovery over 21 days. The
              findings show that SARS-CoV-2 is most stable on nonporous
              hydrophobic surfaces. RNA is highly stable when dried on
              surfaces, with only 1-log reduction in recovery over 3 weeks. In
              comparison, SARS-CoV-2 viability reduced more rapidly, but this
              loss in viability was found to be independent of starting
              concentration. Expected levels of SARS-CoV-2 viable environmental
              surface contamination would lead to undetectable levels within 2
              days. Therefore, when RNA is detected on surfaces, it does not
              directly indicate the presence of viable virus, even at low cycle
              threshold values. IMPORTANCE This study shows the impact of
              material type on the viability of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces. It
              demonstrates that the decay rate of viable SARS-CoV-2 is
              independent of starting concentration. However, RNA shows high
              stability on surfaces over extended periods. This has
              implications for interpretation of surface sampling results using
              RT-PCR to determine the possibility of viable virus from a
              surface, where RT-PCR is not an appropriate technique to
              determine viable virus. Unless sampled immediately after
              contamination, it is difficult to align RNA copy numbers to
              quantity of viable virus on a surface.",
