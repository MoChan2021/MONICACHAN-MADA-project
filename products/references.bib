  abstract = "Efficient microbial sampling from surfaces for subsequent
              detection and quantification is crucial in fields such as food
              safety and hygiene monitoring. Cotton swabs are traditionally
              used for sample collection, but today there are numerous swabs of
              alternative material and different sizes available. Recovery
              efficiencies of swabs for different applications have been
              compared in several studies. However, the results are often
              contradictory. We have compared 15 different swabs made of cotton
              (n = 5), flocked nylon (n = 3) and foam (n = 7), for sampling of
              Listeria monocytogenes and mengovirus on small (4 cm2) and large
              (100 cm2) areas of window glass, ridged plastic and absorbing
              wood. Molecular quantification methods (qPCR and RT-qPCR) were
              applied, and all sampling and sample processing were
              standardized. Specific swabs gave higher DNA/RNA yields than
              others, depending on both the surface characteristics and the
              collected target. The highest DNA yields were achieved by
              applying Selefa or Puritan cotton swabs for Listeria sampling on
              4 cm2 areas of window glass and ridged plastic. Certain foam
              swabs (Critical swab with medium head and Macrofoam) gave the
              highest yields when sampling Listeria on 4 cm2 areas of wood and
              on 100 cm2 areas of ridged plastic and wood. Most foam swabs, and
              especially Sigma Virocult, were advantageous for virus sampling,
              regardless of surface. Nylon-flocked swabs showed poor recovery
              regardless of surface characteristics. The recovery varied
              substantially between swabs made of the same material, suggesting
              that a single swab may not be representative for a certain swab
              material.",

              causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
              pandemic. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain
              reaction (qRT-PCR) represents the gold standard for diagnostic
              assays even if it cannot precisely quantify viral RNA copies.
              Thus, we decided to compare qRT-PCR with digital polymerase chain
              reaction (dPCR), which is able to give an accurate number of RNA
              copies that can be found in a specimen. However, the
              aforementioned methods are not capable to discriminate if the
              detected RNA is infectious or not. For this purpose, it is
              necessary to perform an endpoint titration on cell cultures,
              which is largely used in the research field and provides a tissue
              culture infecting dose per mL (TCID50/mL) value. Both research

              two qRT-PCR protocols (one with preliminary RNA extraction and
              purification and an extraction-free qRT-PCR), a dPCR and a
              titration on cell cultures. The resulting correlations yield a
              faithful estimation of the total number of RNA copies and of the
              infectious viral burden from a Ct value obtained with diagnostic
              routine tests. All these estimations take into consideration

              (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread and increase the number of
              fatalities. To expedite studies on understanding potential
              surface transmission of the virus and to aid environmental
              epidemiological investigations, we developed a rapid viability
              reverse transcriptase PCR (RV-RT-PCR) method that detects viable
              (infectious) SARS-CoV-2 from swab samples in <1 day compared to
              several days required by current gold-standard cell-culture-based
              methods. The method integrates cell-culture-based viral
              enrichment in a 96-well plate format with gene-specific
              RT-PCR-based analysis before and after sample incubation to
              determine the cycle threshold (CT) difference ($\Delta$CT). An
              algorithm based on $\Delta$CT $\geq$ 6 representing âˆ¼ 2-log or
              more increase in SARS-CoV-2 RNA following enrichment determines
              the presence of infectious virus. The RV-RT-PCR method with 2-hr
              viral infection and 9-hr post-infection incubation periods
              includes ultrafiltration to concentrate virions, resulting in
              detection of <50 SARS-CoV-2 virions in swab samples in 17 h (for
              a batch of 12 swabs), compared to days typically required by the

              hospital multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) transmission.
              Factors such as patient MDRO contact precautions (CP) status,
              patient proximity to surfaces, and unit type likely influence
              MDRO contamination and bacterial bioburden levels on patient room
              surfaces. Identifying factors associated with environmental
              contamination in patient rooms and on shared unit surfaces could
              help identify important environmental MDRO transmission routes.
              METHODS: Surfaces were sampled from MDRO CP and non-CP rooms,
              nursing stations, and mobile equipment in acute care, intensive
              care, and transplant units within 6 acute care hospitals using a
              convenience sampling approach blinded to cleaning events.
              Precaution rooms had patients with clinical or surveillance tests
              positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,
              vancomycin-resistant enterococci, carbapenem-resistant
              Enterobacteriaceae or Acinetobacter within the previous 6 months,
              or Clostridioides difficile toxin within the past 30 days. Rooms
              not meeting this definition were considered non-CP rooms. Samples
              were cultured for the above MDROs and total bioburden. RESULTS:
              Overall, an estimated 13\% of rooms were contaminated with at
              least 1 MDRO. MDROs were detected more frequently in CP rooms
              (32\% of 209 room-sample events) than non-CP rooms (12\% of 234
              room-sample events). Surface bioburden did not differ
              significantly between CP and non-CP rooms or MDRO-positive and
              MDRO-negative rooms. CONCLUSIONS: CP room surfaces are
              contaminated more frequently than non-CP room surfaces; however,
              contamination of non-CP room surfaces is not uncommon and may be
              an important reservoir for ongoing MDRO transmission. MDRO
              contamination of non-CP rooms may indicate asymptomatic patient
              MDRO carriage, inadequate terminal cleaning, or
              cross-contamination of room surfaces via healthcare personnel

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Microorganisms comprise the majority of living
              organisms on our planet. For many years, exploration of the
              composition of microbial communities has been performed through
              the PCR-based study of the small subunit rRNA gene due to its
              high conservation across the domains of life. The application of
              this method has resulted in the discovery of many unexpected
              evolutionary lineages. However, amplicon sequencing is subject to
              numerous biases, with some taxa being missed, and is limited by
              the read length of second-generation sequencing platforms, which
              drastically reduces the phylogenetic resolution. RESULTS: Here,
              we describe a hybridization capture strategy that allows the
              enrichment of 16S rRNA genes from metagenomic samples and enables
              an exhaustive identification and a complete reconstruction of the
              biomarker. Applying this approach to a microbial mock community
              and a soil sample, we demonstrated that hybridization capture is
              able to reveal greater microbial diversity than 16S rDNA amplicon
              sequencing and shotgun sequencing. The reconstruction of
              full-length 16S rRNA genes facilitated the improvement of
              phylogenetic resolution and the discovery of novel prokaryotic
              taxa. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that hybridization
              capture can lead to major breakthroughs in our understanding of
              microbial diversity, overcoming the limitations of conventional
              16S rRNA gene studies. If applied to a broad range of
              environmental samples, this innovative approach could reveal the
              undescribed diversity of the still underexplored microbial
              communities and could provide a better understanding of ecosystem

              with COVID-19 to better characterize the potential risks of
              fomite transmission. Ten households with $\geq$1 person with
              laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and with $\geq$2 members total were

  abstract = "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the
              virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019, is a respiratory
              virus primarily transmitted person to person through inhalation
              of droplets or aerosols, laden with viral particles. However, as
              recent studies have shown, virions can remain infectious for up
              to 72 h on surfaces, which can lead to transmission through
              contact. Thus, a comprehensive study was conducted to determine
              the efficiency of protocols to recover SARS-CoV-2 from surfaces
              in built environments. This end-to-end (E2E) study showed that
              the effective combination for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces
              includes using an Isohelix swab collection tool, DNA/RNA Shield
              as a preservative, an automated system for RNA extraction, and
              reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) as the detection
              assay. Using this E2E approach, this study showed that, in some
              cases, noninfectious viral fragments of SARS-CoV-2 persisted on
              surfaces for as long as 8 days even after bleach treatment.
              Additionally, debris associated with specific built environment
              surfaces appeared to inhibit and negatively impact the recovery
              of RNA; Amerstat demonstrated the highest inhibition (>90\%) when
              challenged with an inactivated viral control. Overall, it was
              determined that this E2E protocol required a minimum of 1,000
              viral particles per 25 cm2 to successfully detect virus from test
              surfaces. Despite our findings of viral fragment longevity on
              surfaces, when this method was employed to evaluate 368 samples
              collected from various built environmental surfaces, all samples
              tested negative, indicating that the surfaces were either void of
              virus or below the detection limit of the assay.IMPORTANCE The
              ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
              (SARS-CoV-2) (the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019
              [COVID-19]) pandemic has led to a global slowdown with
              far-reaching financial and social impacts. The SARS-CoV-2
              respiratory virus is primarily transmitted from person to person
              through inhalation of infected droplets or aerosols. However,
              some studies have shown that virions can remain infectious on
              surfaces for days and can lead to human infection from contact
              with infected surfaces. Thus, a comprehensive study was conducted
              to determine the efficiency of protocols to recover SARS-CoV-2
              from surfaces in built environments. This end-to-end study showed
              that the effective combination for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 on
              surfaces required a minimum of 1,000 viral particles per 25 cm2
              to successfully detect virus from surfaces. This comprehensive
              study can provide valuable information regarding surface
              monitoring of various materials as well as the capacity to retain
              viral RNA and allow for effective disinfection.",

  abstract = "The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to occur through a
              number of routes, including contact with contaminated surfaces.
              Many studies have used reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
              analysis to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces, but seldom has
              viable virus been detected. This paper investigates the viability
              over time of SARS-CoV-2 dried onto a range of materials and
              compares viability of the virus to RNA copies recovered and
              whether virus viability is concentration dependent. Viable virus
              persisted for the longest time on surgical mask material and
              stainless steel, with a 99.9\% reduction in viability by 122 and
              114 h, respectively. Viability of SARS-CoV-2 reduced the fastest
              on a polyester shirt, with a 99.9\% reduction within 2.5 h.
              Viability on the bank note was reduced second fastest, with
              99.9\% reduction in 75 h. RNA on all surfaces exhibited a 1-log
              reduction in genome copy number recovery over 21 days. The
              findings show that SARS-CoV-2 is most stable on nonporous
              hydrophobic surfaces. RNA is highly stable when dried on
              surfaces, with only 1-log reduction in recovery over 3 weeks. In
              comparison, SARS-CoV-2 viability reduced more rapidly, but this
              loss in viability was found to be independent of starting
              concentration. Expected levels of SARS-CoV-2 viable environmental
              surface contamination would lead to undetectable levels within 2
              days. Therefore, when RNA is detected on surfaces, it does not
              directly indicate the presence of viable virus, even at low cycle
              threshold values. IMPORTANCE This study shows the impact of
              material type on the viability of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces. It
              demonstrates that the decay rate of viable SARS-CoV-2 is
              independent of starting concentration. However, RNA shows high
              stability on surfaces over extended periods. This has
              implications for interpretation of surface sampling results using
              RT-PCR to determine the possibility of viable virus from a
              surface, where RT-PCR is not an appropriate technique to
              determine viable virus. Unless sampled immediately after
              contamination, it is difficult to align RNA copy numbers to
              quantity of viable virus on a surface.",

We demonstrate that the method concentrates virus prior to RNA extraction, thus significantly improving detection of the virus using a real-time RT-PCR assay across a range of viral titers, from 100 to 1,000,000 viral copies/mL; in particular, detection of virus in low viral load samples is enhanced when using the method coupled with the IDT 2019-nCoV CDC EUA Kit. This method is compatible with commercially available nucleic acid extraction kits, as well with a simple heat and detergent method. Using transport medium diagnostic remnant samples that previously had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 using either the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA Test (n=14) or the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 EUA Test (n=35), we demonstrate that our method not only correctly identifies all positive samples (n = 17) but also significantly improves detection of the virus in low viral load samples. The average improvement in cycle threshold (Ct) value as measured with the IDT 2019-nCoV CDC EUA Kit was 3.1; n = 10. Finally, to demonstrate that the method could potentially be used to enable pooled testing, we spiked infectious virus or a confirmed positive diagnostic remnant sample into 5 mL and 10 mL of negative transport medium and observed significant improvement in the detection of the virus from those larger sample volumes.Competing Interest StatementRAB, AP, PA, RB, SB, RD, DG, TJ, RK, SM, AM, DM, SP, EP, RR, SS, OS, JW, and BL are employees of Ceres Nanosciences Inc.

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: This study was to investigate the CT quantification of
              COVID-19 pneumonia and its impacts on the assessment of disease
              severity and the prediction of clinical outcomes in the
              management of COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS METHODS: Ninety-nine
              COVID-19 patients who were confirmed by positive nucleic acid
              test (NAT) of RT-PCR and hospitalized from January 19, 2020 to
              February 19, 2020 were collected for this retrospective study.
              All patients underwent arterial blood gas test, routine blood
              test, chest CT examination, and physical examination on
              admission. In addition, follow-up clinical data including the
              disease severity, clinical treatment, and clinical outcomes were
              collected for each patient. Lung volume, lesion volume, nonlesion
              lung volume (NLLV) (lung volume - lesion volume), and fraction of
              nonlesion lung volume (\%NLLV) (nonlesion lung volume / lung
              volume) were quantified in CT images by using two U-Net models
              trained for segmentation of lung and COVID-19 lesions in CT
              images. Furthermore, we calculated 20 histogram textures for
              lesions volume and NLLV, respectively. To investigate the
              validity of CT quantification in the management of COVID-19, we
              built random forest (RF) models for the purpose of classification
              and regression to assess the disease severity (Moderate, Severe,
              and Critical) and to predict the need and length of ICU stay, the
              duration of oxygen inhalation, hospitalization, sputum
              NAT-positive, and patient prognosis. The performance of RF
              classifiers was evaluated using the area under the receiver
              operating characteristic curves (AUC) and that of RF regressors
              using the root-mean-square error. RESULTS: Patients were
              classified into three groups of disease severity: moderate (n =
              25), severe (n = 47) and critical (n = 27), according to the
              clinical staging. Of which, a total of 32 patients, 1 (1/25)
              moderate, 6 (6/47) severe, and 25 critical (25/27), respectively,
              were admitted to ICU. The median values of ICU stay were 0, 0,
              and 12 days, the duration of oxygen inhalation 10, 15, and 28
              days, the hospitalization 12, 16, and 28 days, and the sputum
              NAT-positive 8, 9, and 13 days, in three severity groups,
              respectively. The clinical outcomes were complete recovery (n =
              3), partial recovery with residual pulmonary damage (n = 80),
              prolonged recovery (n = 15), and death (n = 1). The \%NLLV in
              three severity groups were 92.18 $\pm$ 9.89\%, 82.94 $\pm$
              16.49\%, and 66.19 $\pm$ 24.15\% with p value <0.05 among each
              two groups. The AUCs of RF classifiers using hybrid models were
              0.927 and 0.929 in classification of moderate vs (severe +
              critical), and severe vs critical, respectively, which were
              significantly higher than either radiomics models or clinical
              models (p < 0.05). The root-mean-square errors of RF regressors
              were 0.88 weeks for prediction of duration of hospitalization
              (mean: 2.60 $\pm$ 1.01 weeks), 0.92 weeks for duration of oxygen
              inhalation (mean: 2.44 $\pm$ 1.08 weeks), 0.90 weeks for duration
              of sputum NAT-positive (mean: 1.59 $\pm$ 0.98 weeks), and 0.69
              weeks for stay of ICU (mean: 1.32 $\pm$ 0.67 weeks),
              respectively. The AUCs for prediction of ICU treatment and
              prognosis (partial recovery vs prolonged recovery) were 0.945 and
              0.960, respectively. CONCLUSION: CT quantification and
              machine-learning models show great potentials for assisting
              decision-making in the management of COVID-19 patients by
              assessing disease severity and predicting clinical outcomes.",

              confirming a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
              Direct detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
              2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acids in respiratory tract specimens
              informs patient, healthcare institution and public health level
              decision-making. The numbers of available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid
              detection tests are rapidly increasing, as is the COVID-19
              diagnostic literature. Thus, the Infectious Diseases Society of
              America (IDSA) recognized a significant need for frequently
              updated systematic reviews of the literature to inform
              evidence-based best practice guidance. OBJECTIVE: The IDSA's goal
              was to develop an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assists
              clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients and policymakers in
              decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid
              amplification tests. In addition, we provide a conceptual
              framework for understanding molecular diagnostic test
              performance, discuss the nuance of test result interpretation in
              a variety of practice settings, and highlight important unmet
              research needs in the COVID-19 diagnostic testing space. METHODS:
              IDSA convened a multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases
              clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic
              literature review to identify and prioritize clinical questions
              and outcomes related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 molecular
              diagnostics. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development
              and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the
              certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. RESULTS:
              The panel agreed on 15 diagnostic recommendations. CONCLUSIONS:
              Universal access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is
              critical for patient care, hospital infection prevention and the
              public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on the
              clinical performance of available tests is rapidly emerging, but
              the quality of evidence of the current literature is considered
              low to very low. Recognizing these limitations, the IDSA panel
              weighed available diagnostic evidence and recommends nucleic acid
              testing for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having
              COVID-19. In addition, testing is recommended for asymptomatic
              individuals with known or suspected contact with a COVID-19 case.
              Testing asymptomatic individuals without known exposure is
              suggested when the results will impact
              isolation/quarantine/personal protective equipment (PPE) usage
              decisions, dictate eligibility for surgery, or inform
              administration of immunosuppressive therapy. Ultimately,
              prioritization of testing will depend on institutional-specific
              resources and the needs of different patient populations.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction
              (RT-PCR) for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
              (SARS-COV-2) diagnosis currently requires quite a long time span.
              A quicker and more efficient diagnostic tool in emergency
              departments could improve management during this global crisis.
              Our main goal was assessing the accuracy of artificial
              intelligence in predicting the results of RT-PCR for SARS-COV-2,
              using basic information at hand in all emergency departments.
              METHODS: This is a retrospective study carried out between
              February 22, 2020 and March 16, 2020 in one of the main hospitals
              in Milan, Italy. We screened for eligibility all patients
              admitted with influenza-like symptoms tested for SARS-COV-2.
              Patients under 12 years old and patients in whom the leukocyte
              formula was not performed in the ED were excluded. Input data
              through artificial intelligence were made up of a combination of
              clinical, radiological and routine laboratory data upon hospital
              admission. Different Machine Learning algorithms available on
              WEKA data mining software and on Semeion Research Centre
              depository were trained using both the Training and Testing and
              the K-fold cross-validation protocol. RESULTS: Among 199 patients
              subject to study (median [interquartile range] age 65 [46-78]
              years; 127 [63.8\%] men), 124 [62.3\%] resulted positive to
              SARS-COV-2. The best Machine Learning System reached an accuracy
              of 91.4\% with 94.1\% sensitivity and 88.7\% specificity.
              CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that properly trained artificial
              intelligence algorithms may be able to predict correct results in
              RT-PCR for SARS-COV-2, using basic clinical data. If confirmed,
              on a larger-scale study, this approach could have important
              clinical and organizational implications.",
